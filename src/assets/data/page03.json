One of the most successful ways to find those with leadership skills is to implement the leadership and innovation practices described in the Catalyst Leadership System. Watch how people apply these practices. Those who work to apply them are likely filled with leadership potential.</p>\n<p>Use Success Plus to create strong leaders. Possible goals might include showing leaders how to create better strategies, teaching them to be more self-reliant, or helping them train their team in leadership.</p>\n<h4><b>STEP 1</b>Foster Trust and Build Teamwork</h4>\n<p>Trust is the engine that makes cooperative leadership work. Identify those individuals who seem more distant or less responsive, and do what is necessary to create trust. When it comes to building strong leaders, you will need trust to form a mentoring relationship, get a high degree of performance, motivate people, and carry out reporting methods.</p>\n<p><a class=\"button button_popover button_icon button_dq\" href=\"http://account.6icatalyst.com/api/popover-dq-create-step-1/\">Discovery Questions</a></p>\n<p><label>What do you need to do to increase trust as you begin efforts to strengthen leaders?</label><br />\n<textarea name=\"increase_trust\" placeholder=\"Enter trust goal...\"></textarea></p>\n<p><a class=\"button button_popover button_icon button_id\" href=\"http://account.6icatalyst.com/api/popover-id-boost-leaders-step-1-id/\">Ideas</a></p>\n<h4><b>STEP 2</b>Define Your Direction</h4>\n<p>Defining direction is imagining something you want and then giving it life by making it the combined focus of all team members.

He decided to lay out a Change Path and put it in motion. He sent out forty invitations as he had done before, but this time he sent them two weeks earlier. Then at one week before and again two days before the class, he sent out a reminder text or email. These reminders included information about exciting drawings, new products, and requests for questions about health needs to create interest and to help him come better prepared to help people.</li>\n<li>James recognized his allies as the host and presenter and made sure they were comfortable, accommodated, and helped in any way.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>James was able to not only increase the number in attendance, but he was also able to provide more helpful information. Because of this, he shared more product, and a higher percentage of people from his classes decided to enroll.</p>\n",
