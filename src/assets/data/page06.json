Consider how alliances built around trust, motivating, and achieving goals can benefit both you and your team. Is there greater unity and productivity when there is trust? Are people more self-motivated when they understand how to form strategies, or plans, that achieve goals? Is performance higher when people are taught how to create and act on their own ideas? Yes, yes, and yes.</p>\n<p>Examples of when energizing alliances can strengthen your performance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Talking to your team about personal rank goals:</b> Discuss your rank goals with identified downline leaders, share your ideas to help them with their rank goals (so you both can achieve your targeted rank), and create an even stronger plan together. Involving them in creating strategies for both of you makes it easier and more effective to promote your own goals with the help of others\u2014without appearing insensitive or demanding.</li>\n<li><b>Being emotionally steady:</b> If you feel torn between family and work, energize alliances with your partner and children. Work out a schedule that works for you and your family. Include them in projects, and celebrate completion and success together. When your family knows what time is family time and what time is work time, everyone feels better cared for, and you perform better.</li>\n</ul>\n",

And people who are in happy relationships have actually worked, really hard, to create these fulfilling relationships? If this is true, then confidence, happiness, rewarding relationships, and success in business can all be linked to your commitment to build your capacity by improving your own skills. This, then, begs the question: If you aren\u2019t seeing success in a particular area of your life or business, what could you do differently, or what skills could you improve to create the success you want?</p>\n<p>Personal Development improves:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>self-confidence</li>\n<li>perception of life (Are you an optimist or a pessimist? Do you blame others, or do you see how you need to improve somewhere?)</li>\n<li>your contribution to and rewards in your life</li>\n<li>how well you grow your business</li>\n<li>your ability to handle stress and adversity</li>\n<li>finances</li>\n<li>relationships</li>\n<li>health</li>\n<li>attitude</li>\n<li>your drive and motivation</li>\n</ul>\n<h6>Tips for Personal Development Time</h6>\n<ul>\n<li>Commit to at least 30 minutes of personal development every day.

They\u2019ve essentially conducted years of research to identify effective methods. The smartest thing you can do is build your capacity and improve your skills by practicing what you learn from these people.</p>\n<p>Take advantage of local events/trainings, conference calls, webinars, and classes. Energize alliances with other leaders by offering to help with events, and learn from these experiences.</p>\n<h5>Resources for improving your skills:</h5>\n<p>Use company websites and resources, YouTube, blogs, personal websites of other leaders, etc. to find resources about growing your business.</p>\n<h5>Find Live Trainings and Events</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>Visit your company websites to find live events. If specialty classes are taught in your area by corporate executives or other leaders and experts, attend at least one of these events each month.</li>\n<li>Network and start creating alliances with other leaders.

Following up is not only a strong business strategy but also a perfect way to ensure people are cared for\u2014which increases the likelihood that people will stay with you on your journey.</p>\n<h5>3 Tips for Following Up</h5>\n<ol>\n<li><b>Personalize your follow up.</b><br />\nAs you help people place orders, make notes of what they ordered and why. Use this information when you follow up. This sincere, personal attention to your customers helps create repeat customers, referrals, and additional classes.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a class=\"button button_popover button_icon button_ct\" href=\"http://account.6icatalyst.com/api/popover-ct-followup/\">Conversation Tips</a></p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><b>Tell them when and why you&#8217;ll follow up.</b><br />\nAfter discussing and helping with any questions, tell people when you\u2019ll follow up and why. Build trust and be responsible by following up exactly when you say you will. The reason you\u2019re following up should always be about the other person. This technique creates an easy \u201cin\u201d for next time, and it shows you genuinely care about them and their family.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a class=\"button button_popover button_icon button_ct\" href=\"http://account.6icatalyst.com/api/popover-ct-touchingbase/\">Conversation Tips</a><br />\n<a class=\"button button_popover button_icon button_lm\" href=\"http://account.6icatalyst.com/api/popover-lm-relationships/\">Learn More</a></p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><b>Be professional and follow through.</b><br />\nShow you are a trusted professional by following through with what, when, and why.

If something unavoidable comes up, follow up and let them know, and then reschedule the follow up.Use a desk calendar or your phone to schedule reminders for yourself. Forgetting may be understandable at times, but it doesn\u2019t help your objectives\u2014either for your contacts or your business.</li>\n</ol>\n<h5>When to Follow Up</h5>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Previous Contact Follow Up.</b> Follow up with previous contacts to ask about their progress with products, how their family is doing, if they have any questions about the business, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a class=\"button button_popover button_icon button_ct\" href=\"http://account.6icatalyst.com/api/popover-ct-when/\">Conversation Tips</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Reminder Follow Up.</b> Follow up to remind people about incentives, rewards, promotions, etc. at an upcoming class.

They provide a really fun, comfortable atmosphere where you can get to know people and help them learn the benefits of these amazing products.</p>\n<p>Classes may have a specific theme: Products for Back to School, Products for Massage and Spa, Basic Product Application, specific health goal, etc. Regardless of what the topic may be, classes are most effective for presenters and attendees when they are divided into a system that is easy to duplicate. Organize your classes into these basic parts, practice your presentation skills, and you will succeed.</p>\n<h6>Before the Class</h6>\n<h5>Prepare and coordinate with your host.</h5>\n<p>Coordinate with hosts about contacting attendees to promote the class. Who is making contacts to promote the class, and what is the contacting schedule and message(s)?</p>\n<p>So they are comfortable, prepare hosts in advance of the class. Review agendas, and discuss how to start the class: introducing you, explaining how they know you, their experiences with the products, etc.</p>\n<h5>Effectively promote your classes.</h5>\n<p>(You can find examples of promoting classes in Step 11 Troubleshooting under the topic \u201cLow Class Attendance.\u201d)</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Advertise in advance and multiple times.</b> For example, start two weeks out so people can plan for the class. Every 3-4 days, send out a new reminder message. Finish your schedule 2 days before the class.</li>\n<li><b>Keep it fresh.</b> Modify each message to keep communication fresh.</li>\n<li><b>Emphasize the benefits.</b> In each new reminder, focus on rewards, incentives, games, free gifts, samples, etc.</li>\n<li><b>Personalize reminders.</b> Strengthen working relationships by making reminders more personal: unique to a person\u2019s specific health needs, specific to a particular event or situation, etc.</li>\n<li><b>Spark interest and reward pre-class participation.</b> Tell people about rewards for anyone who watches helpful and relevant recommended videos before coming to class. This can excite people and increase attendance. And it can help people be more informed when they attend so your classes are more productive and engaging.</li>\n</ul>\n<h6>Teaching the Class</h6>\n<p>To make sure people stay engaged and excited, keep presentation time to 30\u201335 minutes so you can use the rest of the time (15\u201330 minutes) to close and answer questions.</p>\n<h5>Part 1: Greet, Recognize, and Reward</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>Greet everyone individually. Learn and use people\u2019s names to create connections. Learn why they are here so you can personalize the presentation and use this information as you help them at the end of class and when you follow up.</li>\n<li>Strengthen your relationships with those who have helped you by thanking, recognizing, and rewarding the host and other presenters or anyone who has contributed to the class.</li>\n<li>Incentivize future classes by displaying the benefits and rewards of hosting. This is done when you reward the host.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a class=\"button button_popover button_icon button_lm\" href=\"http://account.6icatalyst.com/api/popover-lm-host/\">Learn More</a><br />\n<a class=\"button button_popover button_icon button_ct\" href=\"http://account.6icatalyst.com/api/popover-ct-host/\">Conversation Tips</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reward those participating in any contest or incentive program advertised for attending the class.

It is the way you plan to accomplish your defined direction and selected outcomes. Strategy is a crucial part of the leadership system because it motivates you to face the reality that success will require commitment from you and other people. This is one of your most important leadership tasks. Teach the members of your team to develop strategy as a means of building commitment, self-motivation, and initiative.

It is the beginning of identifying strategies you can use to increase success. Ask questions like, \u201cWhat did we do last month/quarter?\u201d or \u201cWhat would our team be like if we&#8230;?\u201d<br />\nWhen people do not share ideas or ask questions, you do not have a functioning team; you have a group of individuals working on their own agendas. True teamwork is where success is found and multiplied. Good leaders LISTEN!

Duplicate success by learning these traits well so you can teach them to your team.</p>\n<p><strong>TRUST FACTORS</strong></p>\n<h4>1. Integrity, Responsibility, and Accountability</h4>\n<p>People trust you when they see you being responsible\u2014following through, being consistent, staying committed, and taking responsibility for mistakes made or assignments forgotten and then improving. If you have integrity, that means you keep your promises, respect people by being punctual, report to people what you intend to do and then do it, etc. This is related to being accountable\u2014taking personal responsibility and honestly accounting for your actions.</p>\n<p>Build trust in others by giving credit to other people for your success. Build trust by kindly inviting others to fully participate in meetings, accepting their ideas when appropriate, giving assignments with due dates, and recognizing effort and results.</p>\n<p><strong>How will you improve your integrity, responsibility, and accountability?</strong></p>\n<p><a class=\"button button_popover button_icon button_id\" href=\"http://account.6icatalyst.com/api/popover-id-proactive/\">Ideas</a></p>\n<h4>2. Emotional Control</h4>\n<p>People trust you, follow you, and invest in teamwork when you exhibit a steady, reliable, and positive attitude with more self-motivation and enthusiasm and less anxiety and stress. Eliminate anger.</p>\n<p><strong>How will you improve emotional control?</strong></p>\n<p><a class=\"button button_popover button_icon button_id\" href=\"http://account.6icatalyst.com/api/popover-id-positive/\">Ideas</a></p>\n<h4>3. Self-Motivation</h4>\n<p>People trust you when they see you doing something extra to achieve the results you want. Build trust by finding one more contact than you need or scheduling one additional class a week, instead of doing the bare minimum. Build trust in your team by asking them to be self-motivated and do a little more than the least amount required.</p>\n<p><strong>How will you become more self-motivated?</strong></p>\n<p><a class=\"button button_popover button_icon button_id\" href=\"http://account.6icatalyst.com/api/popover-id-self-motivation/\">Ideas</a></p>\n<h4>4.

Building capacity by improving your skills gives you control.</h4>\n<p>Whether contacting people is easy or difficult for you, contacting is necessary. So instead of viewing contacting with fear and apprehension, see it as an opportunity to grow and explore. You\u2019ll be surprised when you put yourself out there!</p>\n<p>The easiest place to start is with the list you made of people you want to contact. To make contacting a little easier, start looking at any contact as an opportunity to help this person, either with products or an opportunity.</p>\n<p>By genuinely caring about others enough to learn about them, you are establishing a strong foundation of trust. When people feel they can trust you, they are more likely to listen, investigate the products, attend or host classes, join your team, and perform at higher levels.</p>\n<p>As you read about the following tips to improve contacting, visualize yourself applying these skills to contacting people in different situations: friends, colleagues, family, a stranger in a pharmacy, contacts from classes, etc.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s get started!</p>\n<h5>5 Tips to Improve Contacting</h5>\n<ol>\n<li><b>Have a positive attitude.</b><br />\nWe are naturally drawn to happy, smiling, positive people. A positive attitude puts you at ease and allows your thoughts to function faster and more efficiently. Expressing a positive attitude while talking with people communicates that you are enjoying the conversation, which encourages people to talk more. And you want other people to talk so you can listen and identify ways you can help them.</li>\n<li><b>Ask questions to generate curiosity.</b><br />\nQuestions are your greatest tool when contacting. Questions generate curiosity\u2014curiosity you have in other people and their curiosity in you. Use questions to relax the conversation (e.g., \u201cWhat do you do for a living?\u201d \u201cHow is your family?\u201d). Listen carefully so this curiosity can grow into conversation that allows you to become more familiar with people and learn how to help them.</li>\n<li><b>Identify common interests.</b><br />\nCommon interests help conversations to flow more naturally. Common interests help people feel comfortable with opening up more. If you don\u2019t feel like you know very much about this person, ask more questions, and look for common ground: hobbies, interests, health concerns (and the products), careers (and the opportunity), skills, etc. NOTE: Pay attention to topics that are linked to your business, but this is not the time to talk about the business. It is time to generate trust and genuine interest in this person so you can better help him or her when it is time to introduce products or the business opportunity.</li>\n<li><b>Focus on others, not yourself.</b><br />\nFeelings of discomfort come when you are too focused on yourself: your agenda, your needs, your business, etc. Trust comes when you focus on the needs of others. When you do introduce the products or opportunity, the trust you have established will lead to a better response. So if you feel nervous, uncomfortable, or like you\u2019re imposing on their time, put the focus on them, and let them share valuable information with you.</li>\n<li><b>Have confidence.</b><br />\nConfidence is not arrogance. People are drawn to those who are confident. Arrogance drives people away. You know the products and business are amazing. Have confidence in them. Use this confidence to convey your genuine interest in people and your desire to help them.</li>\n</ol>\n<h5>Resources for additional tips on contacting:</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>YouTube videos shared by other company leaders</li>\n<li>your upline or mentor</li>\n<li><a class=\"link_kt\" href=\"http://account.6icatalyst.com/api/popover-kt-calls/\">team or conference calls</a>, <a class=\"link_kt\" href=\"http://account.6icatalyst.com/api/popover-kt-webinars/\">webinars</a>, or online recordings on contacting</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a class=\"button button_popover button_icon button_lm\" href=\"http://account.6icatalyst.com/api/popover-lm-confidence/\">Learn More</a></p>\n<div class=\"challenge\">Mark complete after contacting 10 people.<br />\n<span class=\"button button_icon\">complete</span></div>\n</div>\n",

Setting and achieving goals helps you realize you can accomplish more than you thought possible. Goals can be large (\u201chit new rank in three months\u201d) or more moderate (\u201ccontact three new people this week\u201d). What is important is the growth that occurs as you work toward your goals.</p>\n<p>It can be easy to see your goals or where you want to go. The challenge is to navigate how you get there. To help you practice setting goals and creating the strategies necessary to achieve them, this section will walk you through two goals necessary for every successful network marketing entrepreneur: financial and rank goals.</p>\n<p>Be sure to choose a realistic date when you want to achieve these goals. Hold yourself accountable, and commit. Remember, it\u2019s about growth, and you grow when you challenge yourself and then work hard to meet that challenge!</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a simple checklist to help you shape good goals.</p>\n<h5>\u201cGood Goals\u201d Checklist</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>Goals should be reachable\u2014with effort\u2014so you do not become discouraged.</li>\n<li>Goals should challenge you so you are excited, growing, and improving.</li>\n<li>Goals should represent multiple areas of your business: enrollments, volume growth, rank, classes, contacts, income, etc.</li>\n<li>Goals should be set daily, weekly, and monthly. This variety in timeline keeps you motivated and progressing.</li>\n<li>Goals should be reported. Reporting your goals to someone (mentor, spouse, friend in the company) increases your level of commitment and execution.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a class=\"button button_popover button_icon button_lm\" href=\"http://account.6icatalyst.com/api/popover-lm-goal/\">Learn More</a></p>\n<p>The more specific you make your <a class=\"link_kt\" href=\"http://account.6icatalyst.com/api/popover-kt-financial/\">financial goals</a> and <a class=\"link_kt\" href=\"http://account.6icatalyst.com/api/popover-kt-rank/\">rank goals</a>, the more clear your path will be.</p>\n<h5>Setting Financial Goals</h5>\n<ol>\n<li><b>Set a financial goal.</b><br />\nSelect a date a few months ahead, and decide how much money you want to be earning by that date.</li>\n<li><b>Create a monthly plan.</b><br />\nTo know what you need to do each month to reach your financial goal, work backward, setting mini goals for each preceding month.For example, if you enrolled in May and you want to be making $2,500 a month by September, work backward from September and make a plan for each month. Your plan might look like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>September\u2014 $2,500/month</li>\n<li>August \u2014 $2,300/month</li>\n<li>July \u2014 $2,000/month</li>\n<li>June \u2014 $1,700/month</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Working backward like this helps you identify what each monthly goal needs to be.</p>\n<p>Use this information to make your weekly plans (e.g., to make $1,700 in June, you need to be doing $425/week, which might mean you need two classes a week if you close around $225 per class). Adjust your work\u2014contacting, classes, following up, etc.\u2014accordingly to maintain this goal schedule.</li>\n<li><b>Learn from others and from your own experience.</b><br />\nAs you are setting goals and creating your schedule, ask your upline leaders, mentor, or others who are succeeding if your goal plan is strong. Compare your model to theirs, and see if you need to make adjustments\u2014speed things up or slow things down. Use this information to improve your experience. You increase confidence when you can control outcomes, like achieving goals, so learn to create schedules that challenge you but that are clear and attainable so you build confidence as you achieve success.</li>\n</ol>\n<h5>Setting Rank Goals</h5>\n<p>Learn about ranks from your mentor or upline leaders. Then use the same process you used to set financial goals to set rank goals.</p>\n<p>Choose a date a few months ahead, and decide what rank you want to reach by that date. Then work backward to determine what achievements you need each preceding month to reach your rank goal.</p>\n<p>For example, select the rank of Level 7 by September, and work backward from there. You\u2019ll likely need to be a <a class=\"link_kt\" href=\"http://account.6icatalyst.com/api/popover-kt-solid/\">solid</a> Level 6 rank by August. This means you\u2019d need to be at least a <a class=\"link_kt\" href=\"http://account.6icatalyst.com/api/popover-kt-weak/\">weak</a> Level 6 in July and work to be a solid Level 6 by August.</p>\n<p>Here is an example of a rank goal schedule:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>September\u2014Level 7 (weak or solid, but you hit your rank goal!)</li>\n<li>August\u2014Level 6 (solid)</li>\n<li>July\u2014Level 6 (hit Level 6 for the first time, so it is weak)</li>\n<li>June\u2014Level 5 (solid)</li>\n<li>May\u2014Level 5 (weak Level 5, so give yourself another month to strengthen this rank)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you have made financial and rank goals, feel proud of yourself! This is a huge step!</p>\n<p><a class=\"button button_popover button_icon button_lm\" href=\"http://account.6icatalyst.com/api/popover-lm-direction/\">Learn More</a></p>\n<p><a class=\"button button_popover button_icon button_lm\" href=\"http://account.6icatalyst.com/api/popover-lm-plan/\">Learn More</a></p>\n<div class=\"challenge\">Mark complete when you have set financial and rank goals.<br />\n<span class=\"button button_icon\">complete</span></div>\n</div>\n",

Your ideas may never have occurred to them and could lead to very productive relationships.</p>\n<p>You\u2019ll learn more about approaching people later on in Jump Start, but remember these tips as you begin making contact:</p>\n<h5>Keep it natural.</h5>\n<p>Ask a lot of questions, and do more listening than talking. Don\u2019t be pushy. Talk about the products or business when the topic comes up naturally.</p>\n<h5>Build on common interests.</h5>\n<p>If someone mentions work, confidently share what you do and why it works for you. If a friend talks about an illness, share products that can help.</p>\n<h5>Be genuine.</h5>\n<p>Be warm and friendly and always sincere.

These adjustments can make a huge difference.</p>\n<h5>There are a few fundamentals to be aware of as you improve your ability to read people:</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>Get to know people. Start by listening and observing\u2014skills you\u2019ll use constantly when reading people.</li>\n<li>Ask them questions, and learn to pay attention to both their response and possible underlying cues: comfort or discomfort in their voice.</li>\n<li>Watch for patterns. A person may fidget in a chair because the chair is uncomfortable, not because they are not interested in what you are saying. So watch for patterns or multiple cues\u2014take your cues from their words, tone, body language, and face. Is this person only fidgeting in her chair, or is she fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, and tapping her fingers?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The following sections will help you discover how to pay special attention to body language and emotions when reading people, exhibit confidence when presenting, and determine if people are in sync with you.</p>\n<h6>Observe Body Language Cues</h6>\n<p>Most cues come from body language. Watch for positive signs that people are in agreement. Negative signs suggest you need to change something in your message or delivery.</p>\n<p>The following describes what kind of body language to watch for.</p>\n<h5>Appearance</h5>\n<p>What are people wearing?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A business suit may indicate they are all business. Speak and present professionally.</li>\n<li>An exercise outfit might represent their focus on health and wellness. Present associated products.</li>\n<li>Jeans and a t-shirt might indicate a more laid-back personality focusing on comfort. Discuss how products can be shared casually, in natural settings.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Posture</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>Sitting up straight may indicate confidence.</li>\n<li>Slouching might possibly represent indifference or a lack of confidence.</li>\n<li>Leaning forward often suggests interest.</li>\n<li>Crossed arms and legs, more often than not, indicate defensiveness and indifference.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Positive or comfortable body language cues suggesting you are on the right track include&#8230;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>leaning forward</li>\n<li>relaxed limbs that are at their sides</li>\n<li>eye contact</li>\n<li>smiling that does not look forced or gritted</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Negative body cues suggesting you may need to make changes include&#8230;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>leaning away from you</li>\n<li>crossed arms and legs</li>\n<li>limbs that are moving (nervous tapping of fingers or legs, picking at fingernails or cuticles, etc.)</li>\n<li>looking away when talking</li>\n<li>lip biting</li>\n</ul>\n<p>People engage in these nervous behaviors because they take their mind off what\u2019s bothering them and ease their tension.</p>\n<h6>Read Emotions</h6>\n<h5>Eyes</h5>\n<p>The eyes provide an ocean of information. While training or presenting at a class, do people\u2019s eyes follow you? Are their eyes inquisitive, expressing <b>excitement</b> and <b>enjoyment</b>, or are they empty and looking elsewhere, expressing <b>boredom</b> or <b>confusion</b>?</p>\n<h5>Facial Expression</h5>\n<p>Emotions can be etched on our faces. Crows feet or lines at the outward corner of the eyes indicate smiling/laughing and can be a sign of <b>optimism</b> and a <b>positive personality</b>. Frown lines around the mouth may suggest someone is more <b>pessimistic</b>, <b>stressed</b>, or <b>worried</b>.</p>\n<h6>How to Exhibit Confidence</h6>\n<p>Want to take charge when presenting? The brain is hardwired to equate power with the amount of space we take up. Use your posture to express confidence in yourself and your message. Stand tall, don\u2019t slouch, and move to different places in the room and see if people\u2019s eyes follow you.</p>\n<h6>How to Determine if People Are in Sync With You</h6>\n<p>When people mimic your body language, this is a good sign that they are synced with you and interested in what you are presenting. When you cross or uncross your legs, watch to see if they copy you. Tilt your head, and watch if they mirror you by tilting their head the same way. Mirroring is something we do unconsciously when we are in sync with another person. It is a positive sign that things are going well. This can be useful knowledge when negotiating or persuading others.</p>\n<p><a class=\"button button_popover button_icon button_lm\" href=\"http://account.6icatalyst.com/api/popover-lm-read/\">Learn More</a></p>\n<div class=\"challenge\">Mark complete when you have practiced three of these strategies while talking to, presenting to, or training people.<br />\n<span class=\"button button_icon\">complete</span></div>\n</div>\n",

Being confident means you have a level of self-awareness that you can do things well. And things you can\u2019t do well right now, you have confidence you can learn.</p>\n<p>Building a network marketing business can feel overwhelming because so much is new and unfamiliar. Don\u2019t worry. This is part of the exciting process of developing new skills and testing ideas to increase confidence.</p>\n<p>Read the following characteristics of confident people, and consider areas where you want to improve.</p>\n<h5>Confident people&#8230;</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>Regularly stimulate brain growth by periodically choosing interesting, stimulating, or challenging activities.</li>\n<li>Appreciate that mental activities promote physical health, and good health habits promote mental alertness.</li>\n<li>Tend to be optimistic and bounce back fairly quickly after experiencing adversity in their lives.</li>\n<li>Accept responsibility for their discouragement but will use the help of other people to resolve negative moods.</li>\n<li>Are more likely to change their lifestyle than use medication to resolve emotional problems.</li>\n<li>Seek out those who encourage, and avoid people who discourage.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>To start building confidence, use these self-talk statements about yourself:</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>I can do this.</li>\n<li>I am getting better.</li>\n<li>When I pay attention, I learn.</li>\n<li>I have a great brain.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Confident people don\u2019t criticize themselves and instead use positive self-talk statements like these. Recognizing what they do well, they assess areas that can use improvement and then create a plan to improve.</p>\n<p>Start building confidence by improving your mental abilities.</p>\n<h6>Improve Your Memory</h6>\n<p>Developing an effective memory helps build confidence. Most people who have good memories use the following techniques.</p>\n<h5>Associating</h5>\n<p>When you want to remember something, associate it with something you already know or something that will help you remember. For example, you may associate a person\u2019s name with your favorite movie star because they resemble each other. This is a great way to remember the names of people you meet.</p>\n<h5>Metacognition</h5>\n<p>Metacognition sounds really sciency, right? Basically, it means \u201cthinking about how you think\u201d or reflective thinking or introspection. Metacognition helps you improve confidence because it helps you understand how you learn, what you learn, and how you can improve.</p>\n<p>Confident people know how they best learn\u2014by seeing, doing or experiencing, hearing, etc.\u2014and they use this knowledge to develop their skills. For example, how do you learn? If you learn best by doing, do you look for and create opportunities to try new things, or do you shy away from things that are unfamiliar? If you avoid learning opportunities, how are you going to learn and improve\u2014and gain confidence?</p>\n<h5>Categorizing</h5>\n<p>You retain and recall more if you organize the information you want to memorize into categories. A simple example of this is a grocery store. Related items are organized together. Can you imagine shopping if food was scattered randomly throughout the store? It would take forever. Memory is similar. When you organize the ideas you want to remember, you retrieve them easier later. For example, categorize products by how they are used, by their place of origin, or by related health-promoting qualities, etc.</p>\n<h5>Build Confidence by Being Optimistic</h5>\n<p>People who are confident are usually optimistic about themselves and their lives.</p>\n<p>Optimism creates better brain activity and optimal thought and creativity. Optimism increases confidence because you get more out of your experiences when you are optimistic.</p>\n<h5>Are you an optimistic person or a pessimistic person?</h5>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Optimists</b> recognize mistakes when they are made, but they also recognize what they can do and how they contribute to positive outcomes. <b>Pessimists</b> blame themselves when bad things happen and contribute positive outcomes to things other than themselves.</li>\n<li><b>Optimists</b> see bad events as temporary and good events as having long-term causes. <b>Pessimists</b> think the opposite.</li>\n<li><b>Optimists</b> look at bad events as caused by something specific. <b>Pessimists</b> believe that bad things affect every area of life and have universal causes.</li>\n<li><b>Optimistic</b> beliefs help us bounce back from adversity and act to change the situation. <b>Pessimistic</b> beliefs lead to depression, passivity, and feelings of hopelessness.</li>\n</ul>\n<h6>How to overcome pessimism:</h6>\n<h5>Step 1</h5>\n<p>Become aware of your beliefs about the causes of adversity. When you experience adversity\u2014small or large\u2014record the event.</p>\n<p><b>EXAMPLE</b>: You don\u2019t enroll anyone at a class. What do you believe is the cause?</p>\n<h5>Step 2</h5>\n<p>Pay attention to what you tell yourself about the event or the belief you have. Replace pessimism with optimism.</p>\n<p><b>EXAMPLE</b>: If you fail to enroll people at a class, do you fall into despair, feeling hopeless? Or do you identify what you did well and areas that need improvement?</p>\n<h5>Step 3</h5>\n<p>Record the consequence of your beliefs. Your feelings, for example, are consequences of your stated beliefs. Include how you felt and what you did in response to the event. Eliminate pessimistic thoughts and reactions, and create a plan to improve, including necessary change, developing new skills, getting help from others, etc.</p>\n<p><b>EXAMPLE</b>: \u201cIf I feel (recognize the consequence of my belief) that this failed class is temporary and I know what I can do better, the consequences are that I can feel confident in my ability to overcome setbacks by being creative, working hard, learning from others, and improving myself.\u201d</p>\n<p><a class=\"button button_popover button_icon button_lm\" href=\"http://account.6icatalyst.com/api/popover-lm-confident/\">Learn More</a></p>\n<div class=\"challenge\">Mark complete when you have created a plan to improve optimism and confidence in two areas of your work.<br />\n<span class=\"button button_icon\">complete</span></div>\n</div>\n",

The better and stronger the attitude, the greater the results. Many top sales people believe sales are 90% attitude and 10% skill. So one of the most important tools to improve sales is to master your attitude. Being in control of your attitude puts you in charge of whatever you want to accomplish. And controlling your attitude improves your confidence and how you feel about yourself!</p>\n<p>There are eight components to mastering your attitude.</p>\n<h6>1. Envisioning</h6>\n<p>Envisioning is seeing what you want for and from yourself\u2014what you want to become.</p>\n<p>Here is how envisioning is applied to sales:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>First, think about what you currently do when selling.<br />\n<b><br />\nEXAMPLE</b>: \u201cI think about all the times I failed to share product or enroll someone and get down on myself and start to feel hopeless.\u201d</li>\n<li>Second, think about what you want for yourself.<br />\n<b><br />\nEXAMPLE</b>: I want to focus on what I can learn from a sales opportunity whether it\u2019s good or bad.</li>\n<li>Third, think about why you want this.<br />\n<b><br />\nEXAMPLE</b>: I want to be able to control my thoughts and feelings and use this control to improve my next sales opportunity.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a class=\"button button_popover button_icon button_lm\" href=\"http://account.6icatalyst.com/api/popover-lm-behavior/\">Learn More</a></p>\n<h6>2. Developing Strategy</h6>\n<p>A strategy is a step-by-step plan (think road map) you use to control your thoughts and attitude. Strategies are essential because they allow you to test ideas and find what works\u2014keeping the methods that work and eliminating those that don\u2019t.</p>\n<p>Strategies to control your attitude include having a vision for what you want (focus on what you want to BE, not do), the steps to try something and test yourself to see what you can do, and then steps called \u201cbehavior in situations\u201d to ensure you are applying your strategy in the situations where you want to control your attitude\u2014attitude during classes, when closing a class, when working with a mentor, when mentoring others, when work is frustrating, etc.</p>\n<h6>3. Creating Change</h6>\n<p>Without change, we don\u2019t progress. Improvement and success are evidence of change. So change is a good thing. Change is harder if you resist it, think only others should do it, make excuses for yourself, or fear it. Instead, see change as a friend or tool that adds value to your life. See situations where you need to change as positive opportunities to improve, and take control to become the person you want to be. Create change by identifying what you need and want to change, and then hold yourself accountable for carrying out your strategy for making these changes.</p>\n<p>For example, reporting recent performance to a mentor can be viewed as an opportunity to measure your level of responsibility and learn new things from his or her input and observations instead of viewing these reports as someone checking up on you.</p>\n<h6>4. Focus</h6>\n<p>Success increases when you improve your ability to concentrate on what you want for and from yourself. The more focused you are on goals for attitude and sales, the more your brain creates new and exciting ideas. And when you focus, you are more likely to stick to your plan and carry it out, which increases success.</p>\n<p>For example, if you want to improve closing rates at classes, while preparing for each class, focus on your goal: \u201cI want to be more calm and confident so I can enroll more people at classes I teach.\u201d</p>\n<h6>5. Positivity</h6>\n<p>Positive emotions motivate and focus your efforts. Negative emotions distract and distress. Motivation to achieve comes from positive emotions like confidence, security, happiness, enthusiasm, excitement, and fun. Fear of failure comes from anxiety, worry, frustration, anger, duress, discouragement, and sadness.</p>\n<p>The good news is, you can control what you feel by applying emotional control in four ways.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><b>Be aware of yourself and take responsibility for what you feel.</b><br />\n\u201cI\u2019m just feeling stressed right now, so I need to calm down a bit and not take my emotions out on other people.\u201d</li>\n<li><b>Be in control by having consideration for others.</b><br />\n\u201cWhat she said was a little offensive, but perhaps she is feeling frustrated and overwhelmed, so I don\u2019t need to feel offended.\u201d</li>\n<li><b>Be optimistic (or learn how).</b><br />\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand how to do something, but I\u2019m excited about the possibilities of learning new things.\u201d</li>\n<li><b>Reframe your worries to be positive and constructive.</b><br />\n\u201cThings didn\u2019t go as planned, but I learned what I can do better next time.\u201d</li>\n</ol>\n<h6>6. Motivational Control</h6>\n<p>You gain motivational control over your attitude by frequently thinking about two things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><b>results you achieve</b> and the reward for achieving them, and</li>\n<li><b>standards of performance</b> you wish to demonstrate.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For example, gain motivational control over your attitude by identifying your standards for closing rates at your classes and the reward for achieving them. Let your standards motivate you.</p>\n<h6>7. Completion</h6>\n<p>Completion can help you identify your priorities because you typically complete what is important to you. Once you\u2019ve thought about what you typically complete, assess if these priorities are in line with what you want for and from yourself. Are they contributing to your goals? Complete projects that help you to achieve. Eliminate moments when you fail to complete what you started. Improve by setting goals to complete more tasks you start.</p>\n<h6>8. Rewarding Yourself</h6>\n<p>True rewards come with the strong sense of satisfaction you feel when new results are achieved, the confidence from knowing your abilities and not feeling like you have to prove anything to anyone, and the quiet excitement from continued success. These rewards give higher closing rates, sales records, and increased income more meaning. To improve yourself, reward yourself. Reward yourself with fun or enjoyable rewards for acting as you have planned or for achieving behavior goals. Be honest with rewards, and apply them only after improving some part of the components to master your attitude.</p>\n<p><a class=\"button button_popover button_icon button_lm\" href=\"http://account.6icatalyst.com/api/popover-lm-better/\">Learn More</a></p>\n<div class=\"challenge\">Mark complete after you have identified what you want for and from yourself as a salesperson and have created a strategy to BE this person.<br />\n<span class=\"button button_icon\">complete</span></div>\n</div>\n",

Mentoring speeds how fast and how well people learn and perform. Even the best athletes and musicians learn better with a mentor or coach. Being and working with a mentor increases diligent habits, and these habits lead to improved performance.</p>\n<p>A mentor is someone who works with others to discuss ideas or strategies, measure progress, offer suggestions to create or correct direction, identify solutions to challenges, and motivate. Mentors improve how people view themselves.</p>\n<p>Mentors create a growth mindset. This means they may help to identify potential causes of problems, frustrations, or discouragement, but they primarily focus attention and effort on solutions and progress (growth)\u2014not on problems or excuses.</p>\n<h5>Start developing yourself into an influential mentor by considering how you can adopt these principles all mentoring should be based on:</h5>\n<ol>\n<li>developing hope,</li>\n<li>making sure each person feels better after a conversation than before,</li>\n<li>teaching how humility and accuracy lead to strengths because they allow for better learning and improvement,</li>\n<li>understanding the power of the context or situation in which each person lives, so you can accurately help people optimistically focus on hope and future possibilities,</li>\n<li>teaching how trust, integrity, and commitment are the triggers of growth and change, and</li>\n<li>helping people connect positive emotions with change and action plans.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Understanding people can help you be a better mentor. Learn how to gather information about the people you work with, their situations, and how they view them. The better you understand people on your team, the better you can help them.</p>\n<h5>Learn about\u2026</h5>\n<ol>\n<li>the people who will help or hinder change\u2014family, friends, colleagues, etc.,</li>\n<li>the person\u2019s pressures and stresses he or she feels,</li>\n<li>health, education, and age factors that may influence attempts to change,</li>\n<li>family and work circumstances that may add positive or negative influence, and</li>\n<li>how this person views him or herself in their work in terms of performance basics, relationships with their team, and the company policies and procedures.</li>\n</ol>\n<h6>Develop and use these positive mentoring qualities.</h6>\n<h5>Warm</h5>\n<p>Greet people, remember important details about them, praise when warranted, and encourage when there is discouragement.</p>\n<h5>Intelligent</h5>\n<p>Understand people in their situations in life, be expert in the principles of this program, be able to collaborate with a sense of unity and cooperation, use creative approaches, and invite inspiration from other people.</p>\n<h5>Strategic</h5>\n<p>This does not mean manipulative but rather an organized approach connecting effort to desired ends, envisioning the desired change and focusing on it, and organizing action plans a person uses to achieve his or her goals.</p>\n<h5>Persuasive</h5>\n<p>Tell stories of great achievements and success, find incentives that work, use language to motivate, and point out strengths that enable a person to believe his or her efforts will bring success.</p>\n<h5>Pleasant</h5>\n<p>Believe life is more satisfying than not, enjoy life, appreciate beauty, make hopeful statements, and feel optimistic.</p>\n<h5>Knowledgeable</h5>\n<p>Know the principles in this app so well that you can converse positively about them in great detail and understand why they are effective, know the process of change, know the products, know company best practices, and know about people so you can answer their questions.</p>\n<h5>Positive</h5>\n<p>The voice of fear and anxiety is always pessimistic. Optimism (or positivity) is a better way to view life; it means finding good things when there is bad, opportunity when there is failure, hope when there is despair.</p>\n<h5>Firm</h5>\n<p>Motivate by kindly holding people accountable for what they agreed to do, repeat goal statements, review steps taken to develop positive feelings, and ensure that steps people agree to take are clearly defined and achievable.</p>\n<h5>Wise</h5>\n<p>People will trust you if you are calm and collected in response to positive or negative behavior and full of good and helpful facts and ideas. Be willing to allow other people to have good ideas, and make conclusion statements that summarize what people are doing and ratify their efforts to change.</p>\n<p>If you are an experienced leader, consider how to use these ideas to better mentor your team. If you are just starting out, you have a great opportunity to develop yourself into a tremendous mentor. As you learn new things, you can quickly identify the type of mentoring that helps you learn and perform better, and then use this perspective to become that type of mentor to your team.</p>\n<p><a class=\"button button_popover button_icon button_lm\" href=\"http://account.6icatalyst.com/api/popover-lm-alliance/\">Learn More</a></p>\n<div class=\"challenge\">Mark complete when you have identified three mentoring skills to work on.<br />\n<span class=\"button button_icon\">complete</span></div>\n</div>\n",

They aren\u2019t perfect. Leaders are people just like you who develop skills that allow them to transform their mindset, improve their habits, and\u2014most importantly\u2014support and motivate others to achieve more than they ever have before.</p>\n<p>Think about the type of leader you would love to work with, and work toward becoming this leader. Start by considering these nine qualities of effective leaders.</p>\n<p><strong>1\u2014They are willing to learn from others, but they\u2019re also persuasive.</strong></p>\n<p>Effective leaders recognize the value of learning from others. They tend to deflect attention from themselves and think of themselves as neither superior nor inferior to other people and are reluctant to place themselves in positions where they will get more recognition than anyone else. They persuade people by facts, logic, and potential opportunity rather than by aggressive promises.</p>\n<p><strong>2\u2014They pursue excellence.</strong></p>\n<p>They identify high standards for themselves and others and persistently act to continually improve and encourage others to improve.</p>\n<p><strong>3\u2014They are confident enough to stick to something even when it\u2019s difficult.</strong></p>\n<p>When a course of action has been selected, successful leaders willfully persist in achieving it even when the going gets tough.</p>\n<p><strong>4\u2014They gather and tell success stories.</strong></p>\n<p>Successful leaders teach by telling stories. Usually these stories are about what others have done to achieve success, but they also include specific goals and methods of achieving these goals so others may benefit.</p>\n<p><strong>5\u2014They focus on the growth of the team.</strong></p>\n<p>Ego needs are directed toward the growth of the team and not related to personal fame, reputation, or popularity. Effective leaders are focused on making relationships, internally and externally, for the good and growth of the organization.</p>\n<p><strong>6\u2014They implement practices that are not just temporary but are designed for the long-term success of the team.</strong></p>\n<p>Effective leaders have a long-term perspective of the impact of any decision. For example, they train new enrollments and place people based on the highest benefit for the team. Their motivations for personal opportunity in the short term either coincide with the goals of the team, or short-term personal goals may be sacrificed for the long-term benefits to the team.</p>\n<p><strong>7\u2014They stay focused.</strong></p>\n<p>Once committed to a course of action, the most effective leaders display intense resolve to see the goal achieved, a new level obtained, or new practices created.</p>\n<p><strong>8\u2014They accept their responsibilities and give credit to others.</strong></p>\n<p>When something positive happens, effective leaders give the credit to others and tend to take more responsibility when things go wrong.</p>\n<p><strong>9\u2014They work hard.</strong></p>\n<p>Effective leaders are diligent, and they tend to be thorough in their efforts. They expect others to be diligent as they create a culture of self-discipline and focus to ensure success.</p>\n<p><a class=\"button button_popover button_icon button_lm\" href=\"http://account.6icatalyst.com/api/popover-lm-improve/\">Learn More</a></p>\n<div class=\"challenge\">Mark complete when you have identified three leadership skills you want to work on and have a plan to do so.<br />\n<span class=\"button button_icon\">complete</span></div>\n</div>\n",
